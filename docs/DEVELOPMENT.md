# Development

How to build, test, package, and release Tinycast.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 or later (Liquid Glass).
- Xcode 26 installed — it provides the SwiftUI macro plugin and SDK used to build.

## First-time setup

Create the `Tinycast Self-Signed` code-signing identity once — builds sign with it, which keeps the
macOS Accessibility grant from being forgotten every rebuild. Follow **[SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md) §1**
(a few `openssl`/`security` commands).

## Build & run

Open the project in Xcode and run it:

```sh
open Tinycast.xcodeproj    # then press ⌘R
```

Or from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Tinycast.xcodeproj -scheme Tinycast -configuration Debug build
```

`xcodebuild` uses whatever `xcode-select` points at; if that's the Command Line Tools rather than
Xcode, prefix with `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` (the SwiftUI
`@State`/`@FocusState` macros need Xcode's macOS platform).

`Tinycast.xcodeproj` is committed and generated from `project.yml` via
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) — after changing project settings in `project.yml`,
run `xcodegen generate` and commit the result.

### Editor (VS Code) code-intelligence

Autocomplete / go-to-definition come from SourceKit-LSP driven by a `buildServer.json`. Generate it
once (it's machine-specific and git-ignored):

```sh
brew install xcode-build-server
xcode-build-server config -project Tinycast.xcodeproj -scheme Tinycast \
    --build_root "$PWD/build/DerivedData"
```

`--build_root` matches the fixed path the VS Code build task / F5 use, so the editor indexes what you
actually build. Do a build once (⌘⇧B or F5) to populate it. In VS Code, **F5** builds and launches the
app; changes always apply (fixed build path — no need to delete `build/`).

## Tests

There's no XCTest target. Two standalone harnesses:

```sh
swift Tools/fuzz-test.swift                                        # launcher fuzzy matcher
swiftc Tinycast/Core/Calculator/*.swift Tools/calc-test.swift \
    -o /tmp/calc-test && /tmp/calc-test                           # calculator engine
```

`Tools/fuzz-test.swift` holds a **copy** of `FuzzyMatch` from `Tinycast/Core/AppIndex.swift` —
change the scoring in one and mirror it in the other. The calc harness compiles the real engine
sources, which is why `Tinycast/Core/Calculator/` must stay Foundation-only.

## Packaging a DMG

For a local signed DMG:

```sh
./build-dmg.sh            # -> build/Tinycast-<version>.dmg (version from project.yml)
./build-dmg.sh 0.5.7      # -> build/Tinycast-0.5.7.dmg
```

It builds a Release `Tinycast.app` signed with `Tinycast Self-Signed` and packs it (with an
`/Applications` symlink). Official per-channel releases (alpha/beta/stable) are built by CI — see
below and [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Signing & Gatekeeper

Both local builds and CI releases sign with the same stable `Tinycast Self-Signed` identity (not an
Apple Developer ID), so macOS quarantines a directly-downloaded DMG — the Homebrew cask strips that
automatically, and direct downloaders run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "…/Tinycast.app"` once.
Full details in [SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md).

## CI releases

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and publishes a DMG from GitHub Actions — no local machine
needed. Run it from the **Actions** tab (`Release` → **Run workflow**) and pick:

- **channel** — `alpha`, `beta`, or `stable`. Each builds a distinct app
  (`Tinycast Alpha.app` / `Tinycast Beta.app` / `Tinycast.app`) with its own bundle id.
  Alpha/beta get an auto-incrementing `-alpha.N`/`-beta.N` suffix (`N` = the Actions run number)
  so re-running never collides; stable ships the version as-is.
- **version** — base semver, e.g. `0.2.0`.

It builds on a `macos-26` runner with Xcode 26 and publishes a GitHub Release tagged
`v<full-version>` with a versioned DMG asset (`Tinycast-<full-version>.dmg`), marked prerelease
for alpha/beta. On success it also bumps the matching cask in the tap (below).

### Homebrew tap automation

The release job's final step rewrites the `version` + `sha256` of the channel's cask (`tinycast`,
`tinycast@alpha`, or `tinycast@beta`) in the
[`homebrew-tinycast`](https://github.com/abue-ammar/homebrew-tinycast) tap and pushes. It needs a
`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` repo secret — a fine-grained PAT with **Contents: read/write** on the tap
repo. Without the secret the step logs a warning and skips (the release still publishes).

## Website

`.github/workflows/website.yml` builds `website/` (Vite + React + TS) and deploys it to GitHub
Pages at `https://abue-ammar.github.io/tinycast/` on every push to `main` that touches
`website/`. Enable it once via **Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions**.

```sh
cd website && npm install && npm run dev     # local preview
```
